## Contributions

Okay, I know is a bit weird to contribute to someone's portfolio, but maybe you found a bug on my website and because you're a nice and generous person you'd like to report it.
If that's the case, please visit the [issues page](https://github.com/aliciapaz/aliciapaz-portfolio/issues) :)
If not, feel free to visit it anyway.

## Acknolwedgements

My portfolio is inspired by the work of these fine folks:
