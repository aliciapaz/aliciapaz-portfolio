This is a platform game about a dung beetle that runs through the forest while collecting manure and avoiding predators. 

When I worked in ecological agriculture I grew a certain fondness for these little folks (dung beetles). They play a huge role in recycling organic matter in forests and farming systems! I dedicated this game to them to share my passion for nature, education and programming, while learning a new framework.

It's built with Phaser 3 and I used Webpack as the module bundler. It's currently available only for desktop.
