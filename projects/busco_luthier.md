A responsive front-end design for a directory of luthiers* in Santiago, Chile. Made with Bootstrap and HTML5, this design is inspired by Mathew Njuguna's concept.

The live demo is deployed on GitHub pages, and the source code is available for exploration! 


*A luthier is someone who builds and repairs musical instruments.
