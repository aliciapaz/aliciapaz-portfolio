Fritz is a Telegram bot built with Ruby.
It recommends books of a chosen genre (science, philosphy and poetry, among others) and sends quotes according to six different moods.
Feeling anxious, angry or in love? Fritz might have some words to share with you :)

The bot is deployed on Heroku and available for use!

You can also see the code on Github.
