As a gift for my mom on mother's day, I built this single-page-app with JavaScript to show my favorite dishes made by her.

The code is written following a modular pattern and the project uses wepack to bundle all the dependencies and assets.

The app is deployed on GitHub Pages. 

Check out the Live Demo or source code below!
