Outdoor Life is a blog app built with Ruby on Rails.

Users can register and log in using only a name (like in the good old times!). A logged in user can create articles and vote them up.
The site uses Posgres as the main database.

The project is deployed on Heroku and available as a Live Demo, check it out on the link below. Feel free to explore the code on GitHub as well.
